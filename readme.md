> Create permanent terminal aliases instantly

</p>

## Install

```sh
$ npm install --global pluc
```

Now source the pluc output file in your shell. Paste this in your bash profile (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, ~/.bash_profile, , or ~/.profile).

```sh
source "$(pluc-cli --shellPath)"
function pluc() {
  pluc-cli "$@"
  source "$(pluc-cli --shellPath)"
}
```

That also sets up a function to immediately source new aliases. Should you ignore the above bash code, you'd need to manually resource the pluc shell file per session **and** after adding a new alias.

## Verify Installation

```sh
$ pluc --shellPath
# Should output a filepath, not an error.
```

## Usage

Save a new alias forever

```sh
$ pluc <new alias> <command>
```

Leave out `command` and pluc will infer and save your last entered command

```sh
$ pluc <new alias>
```

## Examples

Imagine you ssh to a work machine often:

```sh
$ ssh username@username.example.org
# ssh: Successfully ssh'd to example.org!
```

But truly, you do that most days. Why should you type it out?

```sh
$ pluc sshme
# ðŸ‘Œ Aliased "sshme" to "ssh username@username.example.org" ðŸ‘Œ

$ sshme
# ssh: Successfully ssh'd to example.org!
```

Not only is the alias `sshme` instantly available, it's forever available in any new sessions.

<br/>

Or let's say you do web development and need a web server often:

```sh
$ pluc serve "python -m SimpleHTTPServer"
# ðŸ‘Œ Aliased "serve" to "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" ðŸ‘Œ

$ serve
# Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
```

Ensure you quote any arguments which contain spaces. Otherwise your shell will separate each word as separate arguments.

If you want to see the full list of commands:

```sh
$ pluc --help
```

## About

* Why not use the `source` command in my terminal?
  * `source` is only available within your current shell, so as soon as you start a new session, your alias is gone.

* How are the aliases stored?
  * As a JSON object, located at `pluc --jsonPath`.

* Why store the data as a JSON object?
  * If JSON objects are used as the source of truth, a variety of render methods can be used. This means that **any** output format (`vimrc`, sublime snippets, etc.) which is key-value based can be generated using `pluc`.

* What's one of these "pluc JSON objects" actually look like?

```json
{
  "ph": "python -m SimpleHTTPServer",
  "ga": "git add"
}
```

<!-- * How can I add a new render method?
  1. Create and test a render function as a standalone module. (Fork [build-shell-fn](https://github.com/dawsonbotsford/build-shell-fn))
  2. Add a transpile method in [index.js](./src/index.js). (Copy `transpileJSON()`)
  3. Add a flag for render function within [cli.js](./src/cli.js)
  4. Document the new render method in the `--help` in `src/cli.js`
  5. PR!

## Compatibility Issues

* `pluc` will not create valid aliases on Windows. Windows does not save terminal history.

* `pluc` will not work with `fish` shell. It likely will not work for shells beyond bash or zsh. This is because of the `parse` function in [`@dawsonbotsford/shell-history`](https:///github.com/dawsonbotsford/shell-history) package. PR's welcome.
